## Strategy

Core Steps (Binary Yes/No market):

Identify a directional conviction (“Yes” or “No” is undervalued).
Execute a sizable buy of the favored outcome when its price is around $0.60 (opposite side therefore ~$0.40). In thin order books this visibly moves the favored price to $0.61–$0.62 and the opposite to $0.38–$0.39.
Rely on other participants observing the price action (and possibly your on-chain wallet activity) to interpret it as strong conviction → retail/FOMO buying pushes the favored outcome to ~$0.70 and the opposite to ~$0.30.
At the widened spread, buy the now-cheap opposite outcome at ~$0.30.
Claimed P&L: $0.10 gross per share equivalent (difference created by the spread widening you helped engineer) minus ~$0.03 in assumed fees/gas → net ~$0.07 per unit.

This is not arbitrage. It is a speculative momentum + mean-reversion hybrid that attempts to influence short-term order flow.

Strategy is Not for sale but going to share it to customers.

Pure arbitrage: when YES + NO token prices sum to less than $1.00, buy both. One token always pays out $1.00, guaranteeing profit regardless of outcome.

```
Example:
YES @ $0.48 + NO @ $0.49 = $0.97 cost
Payout = $1.00 (guaranteed)
Profit = $0.03 per dollar (3.09%)
```

# Approve Polymarket contracts (one-time setup)
python scripts/approve_usdc.py

# Run
rarb run --live --realtime
```

## Configuration

Required environment variables:

```bash
# Wallet
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...                    # Your wallet private key
WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...                 # Your wallet address

# Polymarket L2 API Credentials (generate with script above)
POLY_API_KEY=...
POLY_API_SECRET=...
POLY_API_PASSPHRASE=...

# Trading Parameters
MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.005           # 0.5% minimum profit
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=100                # Max $100 per trade
MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=10000              # $10k minimum market liquidity
MAX_DAYS_UNTIL_RESOLUTION=7          # Skip markets resolving later
NUM_WS_CONNECTIONS=6                 # WebSocket connections (250 markets each)

```

See `.env.example` for all available options.

## Contract Approvals

Before trading, you must approve Polymarket's smart contracts to spend your USDC.e:

```bash
# Run the approval script (requires PRIVATE_KEY in environment)
python scripts/approve_usdc.py
```

This approves:
- CTF Exchange
- Neg Risk Exchange
- Conditional Tokens
- Neg Risk Adapter

## Geo-Restrictions

Polymarket blocks US IP addresses for order placement. The recommended architecture:

- **Bot server (us-east-1)**: Low-latency WebSocket connection for price monitoring
- **Proxy server (ca-central-1 Montreal)**: SOCKS5 proxy for order placement

Configure the proxy in your `.env`:
```bash
SOCKS5_PROXY_HOST=your-proxy-ip
SOCKS5_PROXY_PORT=1080
SOCKS5_PROXY_USER=rarb
SOCKS5_PROXY_PASS=your-password
```

See `infra/` for OpenTofu + Ansible deployment scripts.
